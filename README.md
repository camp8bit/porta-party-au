# Portaparty Australia

I've been buying / bidding on bits for this:

* 75ah battery (~25kg) - $60
* 2 house speakers - $50

I put together a control board with a 24 volt boost converter + tripath amp, but I blew both up somehow (bridging
the low level input may have done it). The arduino is programmed and wired up to the snes controller, so that's all good
to go. The control board will also have a voltmeter / ammeter for testing.

## Goal

Arduino powered lighting based on the trike software, using a SNES controller for sequencing the lights. Then
a car-stereo amplifier, or a tripath amplifier (if loud enough) to have as a portal sound system for australia.

## Storage

I'm hoping someone in Erins crew wants to adopt the speaker after the burn, then they can use it for Australia-party-ness
and hopefully it'll turn up at future burns too.

## Charging

Will have two MC4 cables coming out of it to plug into my 30 watt solar panel. Should give it about 15 amp/hours per day
into the battery, which assuming a load of ~ 1.8 amps at night with lights on, should get us through most of the burn.

## Neopixel

Four 50cm strips of 60 led/m WS2812b, inside aluminum channel and with a diffuser (as per porta party v1), if all the gear
arrives in time. Using JST connectors liberally (plus some chocolate blocks) to keep wiring sane.

## Assembly

I'll try and have the control board 100% ready to go, so that when I get to australia I just need a drill and jigsaw
to assemble it into a ready to go portaparty. I'll have two nights in Melbourne, I think it'll only take 3-4 hours if
I do it myself.
